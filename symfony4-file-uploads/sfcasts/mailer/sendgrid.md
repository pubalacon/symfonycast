# Production Settings with SendGrid

If we're going to send emails with SendGrid... we... probably need an account!
Head to `sendgrid.com` and click to register. I'll create a shiny new
`symfonycasts` username, a thought-provoking password, my email and I am hopefully
*not* a robot... and if I am... I'm *at least* a self-aware robot. Does that count?
And... create account! Oh man! Registration step 2! Let's fill these out and... done!

SendGrid *just* sent us an email to verify my account. I've already got my
inbox open and ready. There it is! I'll click to confirm my email and... we're
good!

## Creating the SendGrid API Key

Back on the SendGrid "guide" page, on a high-level, we need some sort of API key
or username & password that we can use to send through our new account. Click "Start"
and then "Choose" the SMTP Relay option.

Yea, I know, I know: SendGrid says that the Web API method is recommended. Most
Cloud providers give you these two options: send through the traditional SMTP relay
*or* use some custom API endpoints that they expose. They recommend the API way
because, if you're creating all of your emails by hand, it's probably easier: just
POST your subject, to, from, body, etc to an API endpoint and it takes care of
creating the email behind-the-scenes. The API probably also has a few extra,
SendGrid-specific features *if* you need to do something really custom.

But because Mailer - and really the Mime component - are handling all of the complexity
of creating the email *for* us, it's much easier to use the SMTP relay.

*Finally*, it's time to create an API key that will authenticate us over SMTP.
Give the key a name - just so you can recognize what it's for 1 year from now when
we've *completely* forgotten. And hit "Create Key".

Check out our beautiful new SendGrid API key. Hmm, actually, down here, it's
called a "Password". In reality, this *is* a SendGrid API key - you *could* use
it to send emails through their RESTful API. But because SMTP authentication works
via a username and password, SendGrid tells us to use `apikey` as the username
and this as the password. It also tells us exactly what server and port to use.
This is *everything* we need. Copy the password.

## Configuring the SMTP Way vs the SendGrid Transport Way

In `.env.local`, we could use all that info to fill in the normal
`smtp://username:password@server:port` format. That would *totally* work.

*Or*, we could use the SendGrid transport to make life easier: just
`smtp://` - the long API key - then `@sendgrid`.

```
MAILER_DSN=smtp://API_KEY@sendgrid
```

The `sendgrid` transport is just a small wrapper around the SMTP transport to
make life easier: because it *knows* that the `username` is always `apikey`... and
that the server is always `smtp.sendgrid.net`, we don't need to fill those in.

In Symfony 4.4, the new syntax will look like this:

```
sendgrid://KEY@default
```

By the way, the SendGrid transport can use SMTP behind the scenes *or* make
API requests to the SendGrid API. In fact, most transports are like this.
Symfony chooses the *best* one by default - usually smtp - but you could force
it to use the API by saying `sendgrid+api://`.

## Sending an Email!

***TIP
SendGrid now requires that you "authenticate" your from address before you can
send any emails. We'll talk more about "sender authentication" in the next chapter,
but to send your first email, you will need to do a few extra steps:

1) Follow https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/sender-verification/ to
   verify a real email address. For development, you can use your personal email.

2) In `src/Service/Mailer.php`, update the `setFrom()` line to use the email
   you just configured, instead of `alienmailcarrier@example.com`.

Ok team - let's try this! Back in the browser, tell SendGrid that we *have*
updated our settings and click "Next".

At this point, unless we've made a mistake, it *should* work: SendGrid is waiting
for us to try it. So... let's do that! Back on our site, hit enter on the
registration page. This time, because we're going to send a *real* email - yay! -
I'll register with a *real* address: `ryan@symfonycasts.com`. Type in a fun password,
agree to terms and... go!

No errors!? Ho, ho! Because it *probably* worked. Tell SendGrid to
"Verify Integration" - that makes it *look* for the email we just sent.

## Our Message is Spammy

While we're waiting... ah! I see a new message in my inbox! And it looks *perfect*.
If you don't see anything, double-check your spam folder. Because... the email
we sent is actually *super* spammy. Why? See how we're sending from
`alienmailer@example.com`? Do we *own* the `example.com` domain? No! And even if
we did, we have not *proven* that our SendGrid account is *allowed* to send emails
on behalf of that domain. This is *the* biggest mistake you can make when sending
emails and we'll talk more about how to fix it in a few minutes.

But first, back on SendGrid... hmm. It didn't see my email? It *definitely* sent.
Hit to verify again - sometimes this works quickly... but I've also had to hit
this button 3-4 times before. So... keep trying.

Finally, it works. Next, our great new email system... will probably result in
pretty much *every* email we send going straight to Spam. Wah, wah. We need to
*prove* that we are *allowed* to send from whatever domain our "from" address is
set to. Let's tackle "Sender authentication".
