# Automatic CSS Inlining

Our email looks good in Mailtrap, but will it look good in Gmail or Outlook? That's
one of the things that Mailtrap *can't* answer: it gives us a *ton* of great
info about our email... but it is *not* showing an accurate representation of
how it would *look* in the real world. If you need to be *super* strict
about making sure your email looks good everywhere, check out services like Litmus.

But generally speaking, there are *two* big rules you should follow if you want
your emails to display consistently across all mail clients. First, use a
*table-based* layout instead of floating or Flex-box. We'll talk about how to
do this... without hating it... a bit later. The *second* rule is that you
*can't* use CSS files or *even* add a `<style>` tag. These will *not* work in gmail.
If you want to style your elements... which you totally *do*... then you
literally need to add `style=""` to *every* HTML element.

But... that's insane! It's no way to live! So... we are *not* going to do that.
Well... what I mean is, we are not going to do that *manually*.

## Checking for the twig-pack

To get this all working, we need to check that a certain bundle is installed.
If you started your project *after* October 2019, you can skip this because you
*will* already have it.

For older projects, first make sure you have Twig 2.12 or higher: you can find
your version by running:

```terminal
composer show twig/twig
```

Mine is too old, so I'll update it by running:

```terminal
composer update twig/twig
```

Now run:

```terminal
composer require twig
```

That... might look confusing: don't we already have Twig installed? Before
October 2019, `composer require twig` installed TwigBundle... only. But
if you run this command *after* October 16th, 2019 - to be exact - the `twig`
alias will download `symfony/twig-pack`. The *only* difference is that the
`twig-pack` will install the normal TwigBundle *and* a new `twig/extra-bundle`,
which is a library that will help us use some new Twig features. You'll see
what I mean.

The *main* point is: make sure `twig/extra-bundle` is installed, and the best way
to get it is from the pack. If you installed Twig after October 2019, you probably
already have it.

## The inline_css Filter

Ok, back to work! In `welcome.html.twig`, *all* the way on top, add
`{% apply inline_css %}`.

`inline_css` is actually a *filter*... and in Twig, you *normally* use a filter
with the `|` symbol - like `foo|inline_css`. But if you want to run a *lot* of
stuff through a filter, you can do it with this handy `apply` *tag*. At the bottom
of the template, say `{% endapply %}`.

[[[ code('34723445f2') ]]]

And... that's it! This passes our *entire* template through this filter... which
is *super* smart. It reads the CSS from inside the `style` tag and uses
that to add `style` attributes to every HTML element that it finds. Yea... it's
crazy!

Let's see this in action. Go back to `/register` and fill the form back in... I'll
use `thetruthisoutthere9@example.com`, any password, agree and... register!

## TwigExtraBundle Invites you to Install Packages

It works! I'm kidding! But it's the *next* best thing. The error tells us *exactly*
what's going on:

> The "inline_css" filter is part of the CssInlinerExtension - try running
> "composer require twig/cssinliner-extra"

Why, what a fabulous idea! This error comes from that new TwigExtraBundle, which
allows you to install several outside Twig extension libraries and start using
them immediately with zero config. And... to be even *shinier*, if you try to use
a feature but don't have the library that the feature requires, it tells you!

Copy the `composer require` line, move over to your terminal, and run:

```terminal
composer require twig/cssinliner-extra
```

When that finishes... move over to the browser again, hit back and... let's change
the email to 9b to be unique. Type a password, hit enter and... go check out that
email! It still *looks* the same... but check out the HTML source. The `style`
tag *is* still there but if you scroll... *wow*. The styles have been applied
to *every* element!

This is one of my absolute *favorite* features of mailer. It's a huge chore that...
just works.

Next, let's use this to clean things up even more. Instead of having all this CSS
right in the template, let's use a proper, standalone CSS file.
