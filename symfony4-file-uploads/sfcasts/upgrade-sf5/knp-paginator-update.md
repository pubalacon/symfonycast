# Upgrading KnpPaginatorBundle & PHP Platform Version

If you look at the list of deprecations, a *bunch* of these mention the same
problem: some `TreeBuilder::root()` thing. This is a low-level function that
third-party bundles use. And if you dig through the list, this
`stof_doctrine_extensions` comes from StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle... as does
most of the other ones - like `orm`, and `mongodb`. The last one comes from
KnpPaginatorBundle.

So basically... we need to upgrade *both* KnpPaginatorBundle and
StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle.

## Upgrading KnpPaginatorBundle the Lazy Way

Let's start with KnpPaginatorBundle... and try to be as *lazy* as possible.
Copy the package name, move over, and run:

```terminal
composer update knplabs/knp-paginator-bundle
```

My *hope* is that a minor upgrade - something like 2.8 to 2.9, which my
`composer.json` version constraint allows - will be enough to fix the deprecation:

[[[ code('df267f5d6b') ]]]

And... absolutely *nothing* happens. It didn't upgrade the library at *all*!
Boo.

## Digging into a Library's Releases

So much for the lazy way out: *now* we need to do some digging. Google for the
bundle and find their GitHub page. PhpStorm tells me that I *currently* have
version 2.8.0. Back on the GitHub page, click on "Releases".

Woh! The latest version is 5.0! And it says:

> Added support for Symfony 5

That's what we want! So, to get a version of this library that works with
Symfony 5, we need to upgrade to 5.0 of the bundle. Back in `composer.json`, change
the version to `^5.0`:

[[[ code('6364b31da5') ]]]

And yes, because we're upgrading to a new *major* version - heck, we're upgrading
*3* new major versions - this *could* contain some backwards-incompatible changes
that will break our app. Let's... worry about that in a little while.

Go update!

```terminal
composer update knplabs/knp-paginator-bundle
```

## Checking your config.platform.php Setting

And... this fails. Boo! Let's see: we tried to get version 5.0 of the bundle... but
it requires PHP 7.2 or higher... and my PHP version is 7.3.6... but is overwritten
by my `config.platform.php` version... which is 7.1.3.

Wow! That's a fancy way of saying that:

> Version 5 of this library requires a higher version of PHP than I'm using

Except... well... that's not totally right. I'm using PHP 7.3, but in my `composer.json`
file... if you search for `config`, here it is: I added a `config.platform.php` key
set to 7.1.3:

[[[ code('efd98912cb') ]]]

This is an optional setting and you might not have this in your app... but I *do*
recommend adding it. It tells Composer to *pretend* like I'm using PHP 7.1.3 when
downloading dependencies *even* though I'm *actually* using PHP 7.3.

Why would I want that? By setting this value to whatever PHP version you have on
production, it will make sure you don't accidentally download any packages that
work on your local machine with its *higher* PHP version... by explode on production.

So if our goal is to upgrade to Symfony 5, our production server will need to
*at least* be set to Symfony 5's minimum PHP version, which is 7.2.5. And
for consistency... even though it doesn't affect anything, under the `require`
key, update this too:

[[[ code('b686fb4472') ]]]

## Updating --with-dependencies

Ok *now* that Composer knows it's ok to download packages that require PHP 7.2...
let's try that update command again:

```terminal-silent
composer update knplabs/knp-paginator-bundle
```

And... yay! Another error! I mean, another *fascinating* challenge that we are
*totally* up to beating. Hmm... KnpPaginatorBundle requires something called
`knp-components` and... basically 5.0 of the bundle requires version 2 of
`knp-components`, but we're currently "locked" at version 1.3, which just means
that version 1.3 is what is installed in our app right now.

This `knp-components` library is *not* something that we have directly in our
`composer.json` file: it's a "transitive" dependency, which is a hipster way
of saying that our app only needs it because KnpPaginatorBundle needs it.

So then... why didn't Composer just update *both* libraries? Because Composer is
conservative: we told it to *only* upgrade `knplabs/knp-paginator-bundle` and
it correctly figured out that it can't *only* upgrade that *one* package.

To fix this, run the command again but now add `--with-dependencies`:

```terminal-silent
composer update knplabs/knp-paginator-bundle --with-dependencies
```

This says: it's ok to upgrade `knp-paginator-bundle` *and* also any of *its*
dependencies. This time... it did the trick: this upgrades from version 1 to 2
of `knplabs/knp-components` and from version 2 to 5 of `knplabs/knp-paginator-bundle`.

## Checking Major Upgrade Changelogs

Awesome! Except... we need to be careful: these are *major* version upgrades...
which means that they might contain "breaking" changes.

Go back to the GitHub homepage for KnpPaginatorBundle and look for a `CHANGELOG.md`
file. Not *every* library will have this... but most do. Let's see: the
breaking changes for version 3 were just removing support for old PHP versions.
For version 4... it dropped support for old PHP and old Symfony versions... and
for version 5, it added a return type to `PaginatorAwareInterface`... which is
not something I'm using in my app.

So... we're good! You could repeat this for the `knp-components` library if you
want, though since we're not using its code *directly* in our app, we should be
good.

Ok, we've handled this `knp_paginator` deprecation. Next, let's update
StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle to remove the *rest* of those pesky "tree" deprecations.
