# API Endpoint & Errors with Dropzone

The AJAX upload finishes successfully... but the response is a redirect... which
doesn't break anything technically... but it's weird. Our endpoint isn't setup to
be an API endpoint - it's 100% traditional: we're redirecting on error *and* success.

But now that we *are* using this as an API endpoint, let's fix that! And... this
kinda simplifies things. For the validation error, we can say
`return $this->json($violations, 400)`.

[[[ code('0e52ea3d99') ]]]

How nice is that? And at the bottom, we don't *really* need to return anything
yet, but it's pretty standard to return the JSON of a resource after creating it.
So, `return $this->json($articleReference)`.

[[[ code('825f3a394a') ]]]

Let's try it! Move over, refresh... even though we don't need to... and select
`astronaut.jpg`. This time... it fails! Let's see what the error looks like. Hmm,
actually, better: click to open the profiler - you can always see the error there.
Oh:

> A circular reference has been detected when serializing object of class `Article`.

This is a *super* common problem with the serializer, and we saw it earlier. We're
serializing `ArticleReference`. And, by default, that will serialize all the properties
that have getter methods... including the `article` property. Then when it serializes
the `Article`, it finds the `$articleReferences` property and tries to serialize the `ArticleReference` objects... in an endless loop.

The easiest way to fix this is to define a serialization group. In `ArticleReference`,
above the `id` property, add `@Groups` and let's invent one called `main`. Put this
above all the fields that we actually want to serialize, how about `$id`, `$filename`,
`$originalFilename` and `$mimeType`. We're not actually *using* the JSON response
yet so it doesn't matter - but we *will* use it in a few minutes.

Back in the controller, let's break this onto multiple lines. The second argument
is the status code and we should actually use `201` - that's the proper status
code when you've *created* a resource. Next is headers - we don't need anything
custom, and, for context, add an array with `groups` set to `['main']`.

[[[ code('0e3b051447') ]]]

Let's see if that fixed things. Close the profiler and select "stars". Duh - I totally
forgot - the stars file is too big - you can see it failed. But when you hover
over it... `object Object`? That's not a great error message... We'll fix
that in a minute.

Select `Earth from the Moon.jpg` and... nice! It works and the JSON response looks
awesome!

## Displaying Errors Correctly

Ok, let's look back at what happened with stars. This failed validation and so
the server returned a 400 status code. Dropzone *did* notice that - it knows it
failed. But, by default, Dropzone expects the Response to be just a string with
the error message, not a nice JSON structure with a `detail` key like we have.

No worries: we just need a little extra JavaScript to help this along. Back in
`admin_article_form.js`, add another option called `init` and set that to a
`function`. 

[[[ code('bdcc0a6cba') ]]]

Dropzone calls this when it's setting itself up, and it's a great
place to add extra behavior via events. For example, want to do something
whenever there's an error? Call `this.on('error')` and pass that a callback with
two arguments: a `file` object that holds details about the file that was uploaded
and `data` - the data sent back from the server.

[[[ code('89d5cbff9f') ]]]

Because the real validation message lives on the `detail` key, we can say:
if `data.detail`, `this.emit('error')` passing `file` and the actual error message
string: `data.detail`.

[[[ code('01d71ab62d') ]]]

That's it! Refresh the *whole* thing... and upload the stars file again. It failed...
but when we hover on it! Nice! There's our validation error.

Next: now that our files are automatically uploaded via AJAX, the reference list
should *also* automatically update when each upload finishes. Let's render that
whole section with JavaScript.
