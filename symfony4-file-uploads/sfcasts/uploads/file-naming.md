# Unique (but not Insane) Filenames

I told the `UploadedFile` object to move the file into `public/uploads`. And it
*did*... but I kinda get the feeling it wasn't trying very hard. I mean, that is
a *horrible* filename. Well, to be fair, this is the temporary filename that PHP
decided to use.

## Using the Original Filename

Fortunately, the `move()` method has a second argument: the *name* to give to the
file. The *easiest* name to use is: `$uploadedFile->getClientOriginalName()`. This
is the name that the file had on *my* computer: it's one of the pieces of data
that is sent up on the request, along with the file contents.

Move over and resubmit the form again. There it is: `astronaut.jpg`!

## Security Concerns

But there are a few problems with this. Number one is security. Boo security!
I know, I know, if the world were more butterflies and ice cream cones, we wouldn't
need to worry about this stuff. But when it comes to file uploads, security concerns
are *real*.

Right now, our upload form has *no* validation at *all*. So even though *we* are
intending for this to be an image, the user could upload *anything*. And to make
things worse, the file will then be publicly accessible. Someone could basically
use our site as a private file storage, even storing viruses and trying to trick
people into downloading it from our trusted domain. We'll talk about validation a
bit later: it is *critical* that you do *not* allow your users to upload *any* file
type.

Side note: no matter how you build your app or what safeguards you put it place,
you should *always* make sure that your web server will *only* parse your main
`public/index.php` file through PHP. If your server is configured to execute
*any* file ending in `.php` through PHP, that is a *huge* security risk. Ok,
back to butterflies and ice cream.

Even after we add validation to guarantee that the uploaded file is *actually*
an image, the user could *still* successfully upload an image with a `.exe`
or `.php` file extension! Even if we validate the file type, allowing fake extensions
is weird... and could be risky.

So problem number one is security and we'll tackle part of it in a minute and the
other part when we talk about validation.

Problem number two is that the filename is not guaranteed to be unique! If someone
else uploads a file called `astronaut.jpg`, boom! My schweet photo is gone!

## Making Filenames Unique

There are a few ways to handle the unique problem - but the easiest one is just
to add some sort of unique id to the filename. Set `$newFilename` to `uniqid()`, a
`'-'` then `$uploadedFile->getClientOriginalName()`. Below, use `$newFilename`.

[[[ code('fdac9b9f24') ]]]

Let's try that! Better. It's kind of an ugly hash on the beginning of the filename,
but it *does* solve the unique problem. You can also use a shorter hash or, when
we actually save this data to our `Article` object, you could use the Article id
instead of the hash. *Or*, if you *really* want to keep the original filename
*exactly* as it was, well... we'll talk about that later when we upload
"references" to our Article.

## Correcting the File Extension

The other thing I want to solve is the possibility that someone uploads an image
with a totally insane file extension - like `.potato`. We can fix this really nicely.
Create a new variable called `$originalFilename` set to `pathinfo()` with
`$uploadedFile->getClientOriginalName()` and the constant `PATHINFO_FILENAME`.

This will give us the original filename - `astronaut.jpg` - but *without* the file
extension: so, just `astronaut`. Then, for the filename, use `$originalFilename`,
a dash, the `uniqid()`, a period, and now the *real* extension of the file:
`$uploadedFile->guessExtension()`. Oh, see how there are *two* methods:
`->guessClientExtension()` and `->guessExtension()`? The difference is important:
the `guessExtension()` method looks at the file *contents*, determines the mime
type, and returns the file extension for that. But the `guessClientExtension()` uses
the mime type the *user* sent... which can't be trusted.

[[[ code('9d2415a258') ]]]

So, we're not validating that this is an image file yet, but no matter what they
upload, we should now get the correct file extension.

Give it a try! Nice! We've got a `.jpeg` ending.

## Optional: Normalizing Filenames

There's one last thing you might want to do... and it's really optional. Go back
to the form. One of my files has uppercase letters and spaces inside. Let's try
uploading that. It works! There is *no* problem with storing spaces or... *most*
weird characters on a filesystem. But if you want to guarantee cleaner filenames,
there's an easy way to do that. I'll use a class called `Urlizer`: this comes from
the `gedmo/doctrine-extensions` library. It has a nice method called
`urlize()` and we can wrap our `$originalFilename` in that to make it a bit cleaner.

[[[ code('7739cbc75d') ]]]

Try that out. Nice! So now we have a unique, normalized filename that at least
*looks* a bit like the original filename. Later, we'll see how we can keep the
*exact* original filename in *all* cases... if you care. But unless your users are
downloading these files, the exact filenames aren't usually that important.

Next: it's time to put this upload field *properly* into our Symfony form and save
the filename to the `Article` entity.
