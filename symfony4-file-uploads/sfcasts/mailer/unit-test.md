# Unit Testing our Emails

Other than code organization, one of the benefits of putting logic into a service
is that we can unit test it. Ok, to be *fully* honest, this chapter doesn't have
a lot to do with Mailer. Unit tests *pretty* much look the same no matter *what*
you're testing. But unit testing is a great practice... and I hate when code does
weird things... especially code that sends emails.

## make:unit-test

Let's use MakerBundle to bootstrap a test for us. At your terminal, run:

```terminal
php bin/console make:unit-test
```

Answer `MailerTest`. This generates a *super* simple unit test file:
`tests/MailerTest.php`. 

[[[ code('a5d775c90c') ]]]

The idea is that this will test the `Mailer` class,
which lives in the `Service/` directory. Inside `tests/`, create a new
`Service/` directory to match that and move `MailerTest` inside. You typically
want your test directory structure to match your `src/` structure. Inside the file,
don't forget to add `\Service` to the namespace to match the new location.

## Running the Tests

Ok! Our test asserts that true is true! I'm not so easily convinced... we better
run PHPUnit to be sure. At your terminal, run it with:

```terminal
php bin/phpunit
```

This script is a small wrapper around PHPUnit... and it will *install* PHPUnit
the first time you run it. Then... it passes!

Oh! But it *did* print out a deprecation notice. One of the superpowers of this
wrapper around PHPUnit - called the phpunit-bridge - is that it prints out warnings
about any deprecated code that the code in your tests hit. This is a great tool
when you're getting ready to upgrade your app to the next major Symfony version.
But more on that in a future tutorial. We'll just ignore these.

## Writing the Unit Test

Let's get to work! So... what *are* we going to test? Well, we probably want to
test that the mail was actually *sent*... and maybe we'll assert a few things
about the `Email` object itself. Unit tests always start the same way: by
instantiating the class you want to test.

Back in `MailerTest`, rename the method to `testSendWelcomeMessage()`. 

[[[ code('79fbc5e113') ]]]

Then add `$mailer = new Mailer()`. For this to work, we need to pass the 4 dependencies:
objects of the types `MailerInterface`, `Twig`, `Pdf` and `EntrypointLookupInterface`.
In a unit test, instead of using *real* objects that really *do* send emails...
or render Twig templates, we use mocks.

For the first, say `$symfonyMailer = this->createMock()`... and because the first
argument needs to be an instance of `MailerInterface`, that's what we'll mock:
`MailerInterface::class`.

[[[ code('f0e8c5e83f') ]]]

To make sure we don't forget to actually *send* the email, we can add an assertion
to this mock: we can tell PHPUnit that the `send` method *must* be called exactly
one time. Do that with `$symfonyMailer->expects($this->once())` that the
`->method('send')` is called.

[[[ code('20c27cdb0c') ]]]

Let's create the 3 other mocks: `$pdf = this->createMock(Pdf::class)`... and the
other two are for `Environment` and `EntrypointLookupInterface`:
`$twig = $this->createMock(Environment::class)` and
`$entrypointLookup = $this->createMock(EntrypointLookupInterface::class)`.

[[[ code('62303f5963') ]]]

These three objects aren't even used in this method... so we don't need to add
any assertions to them or configure any behavior. Finish the `new Mailer()` line
by passing `$symfonyMailer`, `$twig`, `$pdf` and `$entrypointLookup`. Then, call
the method: `$mailer->sendWelcomeMessage()`. Oh, to do *this*, we need a `User`
object.

[[[ code('3e42083f2a') ]]]

Should we mock the `User` object? We could, but as a general rule, I like to mock
services but manually instantiate simple "data" objects, like Doctrine entities.
The reason is that these classes don't have dependencies and it's usually
dead-simple to put whatever data you need on them. Basically, it's easier to create
the *real* object, than create a mock.

Start with `$user = new User()`. And... let's see... the only information that
we use from `User` is the email and first name. For `$user->setFirstName()`, let's
pass the name of my brave co-author for this tutorial: `Victor`!
And for `$user->setEmail()`, him again `victor@symfonycasts.com`. Give this
`$user` variable to the `sendWelcomeMessage()` method.

[[[ code('6f172e98e2') ]]]

By the way, if you're enjoying this tutorial, you can thank Victor personally
by emailing him photos of your cat *or* by sending tuna *directly* to his cat Ponka.

And... done! We're not asserting anything down *here*... but we *do* have one
built-in assert above: our test will fail unless the `send()` method is called
exactly once.

Let's try this! Fly over to your terminal, I'll clear my screen, then run:

```terminal
php bin/phpunit
```

It passes! The power!

## Asserting Info on the Email

The tricky thing is that the majority of this method is about creating the
`Email`... and we're not testing what *that* object looks like at all. And...
maybe we don't need to? I tend to unit test logic that scares me and manually
test other things - like the wording inside an email. But let's *at least* assert
a few basic things.

How? An easy way is to return the email from each method: `return $email` and
then advertise that this method returns a `TemplatedEmail`. I'll do the same
for the other method: `return $email` and add the `TemplatedEmail` return
type.

[[[ code('864fc3f982') ]]]

You don't *have* to do this, but it'll make our unit test more useful and keep
it simple. *Now* we can say `$email = $mailer->sendWelcomeMessage()` and we can
check pretty much *anything* on that email.

I'll paste in some asserts:

[[[ code('5e9fb75299') ]]]

***TIP
In Symfony 4.4 and higher, use `new Address()` - it works the same way as the
`NamedAddress` we use here.
***

These check the subject, that the email is sent to exactly one person *and* checks
to make sure that the "to" has the right info.

Let's give this a try! Move over and run:

```terminal
php bin/phpunit
```

All green! Next, let's do this same thing for the author weekly report email.
Actually... the "email" part of this method is, once again, *pretty* simple.
The *complex* part is the PDF-generation logic. Want to test to make sure the
template *actually* renders correctly and the PDF is *truly* created? We can't do
that with a pure unit test... but we *can* with an integration test. That's next.
