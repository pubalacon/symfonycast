# Edit Endpoint & Deserialization

I want more fancy! Seriously, we're going to add pretty much *everything* we can
think of to make this a sweet, flexible, sort of, file "gallery". What about allowing
the user to *update* a file reference?

Okay, well, we're not going to allow the user to update the *actual* attached file,
there's just no point. Want to upload a newer version of a file? Just delete
the old one and upload the new one. Feature, done!

But we *could* allow them to change the filename. Remember: this is the *original*
filename. And, yea, if they uploaded a file called `astronaut.jpeg`, it would
be totally cool to let them change that to something else after. Let's do it!

## The Update API Endpoint

Let's keep thinking about our `ArticleReference` routes as a set of nice, RESTful
API endpoints. We already have an endpoint to create and delete an `ArticleReference`.
This will be an endpoint to *edit* a reference... except that the only field the
user will be allowed to edit will be the `originalFilename`.

Copy the beginning of our delete endpoint, paste, close it up and we'll
call this `updateArticleReference()`. Keep the same URL, but change the route name
to `admin_article_update_reference` - it should be *reference*, not *references*,
let's fix that in both places - I don't think I'm referencing that route name
anywhere. And instead of `methods={"DELETE"}`, use `methods={"PUT"}`.

[[[ code('61b8a633d0') ]]]

Cool! Let's think about how we want this endpoint to work. First, our JavaScript
will send a request with a JSON body that contains the data that should be updated
on the `ArticleReference`. In this case, the data will have only one field:
`originalFilename`.

## Deserializing JSON

So far, we've been using `$this->json()` to turn an object or multiple objects
into JSON. This uses Symfony's serializer behind the scenes. Now we're going
to use the serializer to do the opposite: to turn JSON *back* into an
`ArticleReference` object. That's called deserialization and... it's... pretty
freakin' awesome!

Let's add a few more arguments: `SerializerInterface $serializer` and `Request` -
the one from `HttpFoundation` - so we can read the raw JSON body.

[[[ code('3db8482b0c') ]]]

To automagically turn the JSON into an `ArticleReference` object, say
`$serializer->deserialize()`. The serializer only has these two methods: `serialize()`
and `deserialize()`. 

[[[ code('1314198ce6') ]]]

This method needs the raw JSON from the request - that's `$request->getContent()`, 
what *type* of object to turn this into - `ArticleReference::class` - and 
the *format* of the data: `json`, because the serializer can also handle XML 
or any crazy format you dream up.

[[[ code('9f3f5a5335') ]]]

Finally, we can pass some options - called "context". By default, `deserialize()`
will always create a *new* object... but we want it to update an *existing*
object. To do that, pass an option called `object_to_populate` set to `$reference`.

[[[ code('c028ac791c') ]]]

Oh, and when we've been *serializing*, we've been passing a `groups` option, which
tells the serializer to put the properties from the "main" group into the JSON.
We can do the same thing here: we don't want a clever user to be able to update
the internal filename or the `id`: we need to restrict their power to changing
the `originalFilename`.

Above `$originalFilename`, turn the groups value into an array and give it a second
group: `input`.

[[[ code('62998df7db') ]]]

In the controller, *way* back down here, set `groups` to `input`. So if any other
fields or passed, they'll just be ignored.

[[[ code('edf1d12b88') ]]]

And... yea, that's it! We *do* need to think about validation - but, pff, we'll
handle that later - like in 2 minutes. Right now we can celebrate with
`$entityManager->persist($reference)`... which we technically don't need because
this isn't a new object, but I usually add it, and `$entityManager->flush()`.

[[[ code('e569659455') ]]]

What should we return? Typically after you edit a resource in an API, we return
that resource again. Scroll all the way up to our upload endpoint and steal the
JSON logic. We could also refactor this into a private method if we wanted to avoid
duplication. Back down in *our* method, paste, rename the variable to `$reference`
and use 200 as the status code: we're not *creating* a resource in this case.

[[[ code('a69b05cc3c') ]]]

Ok, that endpoint should be good! Or at least, we're ready to hook up our JavaScript
so we can find out if it explodes when we use it! That's next.
