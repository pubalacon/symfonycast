# Upgrading Recipes: New Commands!

Fun fact time! When you start a brand new Symfony project, behind the scenes, what
you're *actually* doing is cloning this repository: `symfony/skeleton`. Yep,
your app *literally* starts as a single `composer.json` file. But as *soon* as
Composer installs your dependencies, the app is suddenly filled with a few
directories and about 15 files.

## All Config Files Come from a Recipe

*All* of those things are added by different *recipes*. So even the most "core"
files - for example, `public/index.php`, the file that our web server executes,
is added by a recipe!

[[[ code('0f45ff649c') ]]]

We pretty much *never* need to look inside here or do anything, even though it's
*critical* to our app working.

Another example is `config/bootstrap.php`:

[[[ code('94eca5784e') ]]]

the boring, low-level file that initializes and normalizes environment variables.
It's important that all Symfony projects have the same version of this file.
If they didn't, some apps might work different than others... even if they have
the same version of Symfony. Think of trying to write documentation for thousands
of projects that all work a *little* bit differently. It's literally my nightmare.

All of the configuration files were *also* originally added by recipes. For example,
`cache.yaml` comes from the recipe for `symfony/framework-bundle`:

[[[ code('4aefb7feb1') ]]]

## Why Recipes Update

Over time, the recipes *themselves* tend to change. If we installed the
`symfony/framework-bundle` today, it *might* give us a slightly *different*
`cache.yaml` file.

There are three reasons that a recipe might change. First, someone might update
a recipe *just* because they want to add more examples or add some documentation
comments to a config file. Those changes... aren't super important.

Or, second, someone might update a configuration file inside a recipe to activate
a new feature that's probably from a new version of that library. These
changes aren't *critical* to know about... but it *is* nice to know if a great new
feature is suddenly available. We saw that a few minutes ago when the updated
MonologBundle recipe told us about a cool option for filtering logs by status code.

The third reason a recipe might update is because something needs to be fixed,
or we decide that we want to change some significant behavior. These changes
*are* important.

Let me give you an example: during the first year after Symfony 4.0, several small
but meaningful tweaks were made to the `bootstrap.php` file to make sure that
environment variables have *just* the right behavior. If you started your project
on Symfony 4.0 and never "updated" the `bootstrap.php` file, your app will be
handling environment variables in a different way than other apps. That's... not
great: we want our `bootstrap.php` file to look *exactly* like it should.

## New Recipe Commands!

A few minutes ago, when we did all the composer updating stuff, one of the packages
that we upgraded was `symfony/flex` itself: we upgraded it to `1.6.0`:

[[[ code('dced1a48f3') ]]]

Well guess what?! Starting in Flex `1.6.0`, there are some brand new fancy, amazing,
incredible commands inside Composer to help inspect & upgrade recipes. It still takes
a little bit of work and care, but the process is now very possible. A big thanks to
community member and friend [maxhelias](https://github.com/maxhelias) who really
helped to get this done.

Let's go check them out! Move over to your terminal and run:

```terminal
composer recipes
```

Cool! This lists *every* recipe that we have installed and whether or not there is
an update available. Heck, it will even show you if a package that's installed
*has* a recipe that you're missing - maybe because it was added later.

Because my project was originally created on Symfony 4.0, it's fairly old and a
*lot* of recipes have updates. The recipe system is *also* relatively new, so I
think there were more updates during the first 2 years of that system than there
will be in the *next* two years. We've got some work to do. Of course, we could
just *ignore* these recipe updates... but we're risking our app not working quite
right or missing info about new features.

## Inspecting the twig/extension Recipe

Let's look at one of these more closely. How about `twig/extensions`. This is not
a particularly important library, but it's a nice one to start with. Run:

```terminal
composer recipes twig/extensions
```

to see more details. Interesting: it has a link to the installed version of the
recipe. Let's go check that out in the browser. Paste and... this is what the
recipe looked like the *moment* we installed it. We can also go grab the URL to
see what the *latest* version of the recipe looks like.

Check out the commit history. The version of the recipe *we* have installed has
a commit hash starting with `c986`. Back on the history, hey! That commit is
right here! So this recipe *is* out of date, but the *only* change that's been
made is this *one* commit. Inside it... search for `twig/extensions` to find
its changes. Ha! It's totally superficial: we changed from using tilde (`~`)
to `null`... but just for clarity: those are equivalent in YAML.

Yep! The update to `twig/extension` is not important *at all*. We *could* still
update it - and I'll show you how next. But I'm going to skip it for now. Because...
this is a tutorial about upgrading Symfony! So I want to focus on upgrading the
recipes for everything that starts with `symfony/`.

Let's start that process next by focusing on, surprisingly, one of the *most*
important recipes: `symfony/console`.
