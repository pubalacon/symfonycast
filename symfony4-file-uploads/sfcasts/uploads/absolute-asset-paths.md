# Absolute Asset Paths

One of the things I've noticed is that this word `uploads` - the directory where
uploads are being stored - is starting to show up in a few places. We have it here
in our `liip_imagine` config file, the `oneup_flysystem.yaml` file and in
`UploaderHelper`: it's used in `getPublicPath()`.

## Centralizing the uploads/ Path

It's not a *huge* problem, but repetition is a bummer and this will cause some
issues when moving to S3: we'll need to hunt down all of these paths and change
them to point to the S3 domain.

Let's tighten this up. In `services.yaml`, create two new parameters: The first
will be `uploads_dir_name` set to `uploads` - this is the name of the directory
where we are storing uploaded files. Call the second one `uploads_base_url` and
set this to almost the same thing: `/` and then `%uploads_dir_name%`. This represents
the base URL to the uploaded assets.

[[[ code('dd0b574f35') ]]]

Thanks to these, we can do some cleanup! In `liip_imagine.yaml`, we need the URL.
Copy `uploads_base_url` and then use `%uploads_base_url%`.

[[[ code('2aa9eb74f7') ]]]

Next, in `oneup_flysystem.yaml`, we need the directory name. Copy the other parameter:
`%uploads_dir_name%`.

[[[ code('c352ae4faa') ]]]

The last place is in `UploaderHelper`. The `getBasePath()` call will give us the
directory where the site is installed - usually an empty string. Then we need to
pass in the `uploads_base_url` parameter.

Add a new argument to the constructor: `string $uploadedAssetsBaseUrl`. I'll create
the property by hand and give it a slightly different name: `$publicAssetBaseUrl`,
not for any particular reason. Set that in the constructor:

[[[ code('49c02c8939') ]]]

Back in `getPublicPath()`, use this: `getBasePath()` then `$this->publicAssetsBaseUrl`,
which will contain the `/` at the beginning.

[[[ code('1f011735ef') ]]]

Cool! But, Symfony will not be able to autowire this string argument. You can
see the error if you try to reload any page. Yep!

We know how to fix that: back in `services.yaml`, add a bind:
`$uploadedAssetsBaseUrl` set to `%uploads_base_url%`. Now... it works!

## Linking to the Full Image

Small step, but with all this config in one spot, we can do something kinda cool...
with almost no effort. But first, I want to *triple* check that all this public
path stuff is setup correctly. Our `getPublicPath()` method is currently used
in one spot: by the `uploaded_asset()` Twig function. But, we're not actually
*using* this Twig function anywhere at the moment.

So try this: in the form, we're showing the thumbnail. It might be useful to allow
the user to click this and see the *original* image. That's pretty easy: add
`<a href="">` and use `uploaded_asset(articleForm.vars.data.imagePath)`.

That's it! Wrap this around the `img` tag and let's also add `target="_blank"`.

[[[ code('0785fbef18') ]]]

Cool. Test that - refresh and... click. Nice! This sends us directly to the *source*
image.

## Absolute URLs

Thanks to our setup, we can now solve a really annoying problem. Inspect element
on the image: notice that both the `href` and the image `src` paths do *not*
contain the domain name. That's not a problem at *all* in a normal web context.
But if you ever try to render a page into a PDF with something like `wkhtmltopdf`
or create a console command to send an email that references an uploaded file,
well... suddenly, those paths will start to break! In those contexts, you *need*
the URLs to be absolute.

There are a few ways to solve this... and honestly, I went back and forth on the
best approach. I finally settled on something that we've used here on SymfonyCasts
for years. Open your `.env` file. We're going to create a brand new, custom
environment variable called `SITE_BASE_URL`. Set the default value to
`https://localhost:8000`.

[[[ code('c6b6b762eb') ]]]

Remember: this file *is* committed to git, so this is the *default* value. You
can create a `.env.local` file to override this value locally or on production.
Or, of course, if it's easy, you can override this by setting a real environment
variable.

Next, go back to `services.yaml`. And for the `uploads_base_url`, use
`%env()%` and inside, `SITE_BASE_URL`: that's the syntax for referencing an
environment variable.

[[[ code('60d333e17a') ]]]

And... just like that - *every* single path to every single uploaded asset will now
be absolute. Seriously! Test it out! Boom! Both the link `href` and the image `src`
contain the `https://localhost:8000` part.

And, sure, you could add some config so that you could turn this on only when you
need it... but I don't really see the point. I'll keep absolute URLs always.

Next: let's start uploading *private* assets: stuff that can't be put into the
`public/` directory because we need to check security before we let a user download
it.
