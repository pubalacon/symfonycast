# Hello Webpack Encore

Yo friends! It's Webpack time! Yeeeeeeah! Well, maybe not *super* "yeeeeeeah!"
if *you* are the person responsible for installing and *configuring* Webpack...
Cause, woh, yea, that can be tough! Unless... you're using Webpack Encore!
More about that in a few minutes.

## Why all the Webpack Buzz?

But first, I want you to know why you should *care* about Webpack... like super
please-let-me-start-using-webpack-right-now-and-never-stop-using-it kind of care.
Sure, *technically*, Webpack is just a tool to build & compile your JavaScript
and CSS files. But, it will *revolutionize* the way you write JavaScript.

The reason is *right* on their homepage! In PHP, we organize our code into small
files that work together. But then, traditionally, in JavaScript, we just *smash*
all our code into one gigantic file. Or, if we *do* split them up, it's still a pain
because we *then* need to remember to go add a new `script` tag to every page that
needs it... and those script tags need to be in *just* the right order. If they're
not, kaboom! And even if you *do* have a build system like Gulp, you *still* need
to manage keeping all of the files listed there and in the right order. How can our
code be *so* nicely organized in PHP, but such a disaster in JavaScript?

Webpack changes this. Suppose we have an `index.js` file but we want to organize
a function into a different, `bar.js` file. Thanks to Webpack, you can "export"
that function as a value from `bar.js` and then *import* and use it in `index.js`.
Yes, we can *organize* our code into small pieces! Webpack's job is to read
`index.js`, parse through *all* of the `import` statements it finds, and output
*one* JavaScript file that has everything inside of it. Webpack is a huge
over-achiever.

So let's get to it! To import or... *Webpack* the *maximum* amount of knowledge
from this tutorial, download the course code from this page and code along with me.
After you unzip the file, you'll find a `start/` directory that has the same
code I have here: a Symfony 4 app. Open up the `README.md` file for all the setup
details.

The last step will be to open a terminal, move into the project and start a web server.
I'm going to use the Symfony local web server, which you can get from
https://symfony.com/download. Run it with:

```terminal
symfony serve
```

Then, swing back over to your browser and open up https://localhost:8000 to see...
The Space Bar! An app we've been working on throughout our Symfony series. And,
we *did* write some JavaScript and CSS in that series... but we kept it *super*
traditional: the JavaScript is pretty boring, and there are multiple files but
each has its own `script` tag in my templates.

This is *not* the way I really code. So, let's do this correctly.

## Installing WebpackEncoreBundle + Recipe

So even though both Webpack and Encore are *Node* libraries, if you're using Symfony,
you'll install Encore via composer... well... sort of. Open a new terminal tab and run:

```terminal
composer require encore
```

This downloads a small bundle called WebpackEncoreBundle. Actually, Encore *itself*
can be used with any framework or any language! But, it works *super* well with Symfony,
and this thin bundle is part of the reason.

This bundle *also* has a Flex *recipe* - oooooOOOOooo - which gives us some files
to get started! If you want to use Webpack from *outside* of a Symfony app, you would
just need these files in your app.

Back in the editor, check out `package.json`:

[[[ code('c7464183b0') ]]]

*This* is the `composer.json` file of the Node world. It requires Encore itself
plus two optional packages that we'll use:

[[[ code('d8e8d4b756') ]]]

## Installing Encore via Yarn

To actually *download* these, go back to your terminal and run:

```terminal
yarn
```

Or... `yarn install` if you're less lazy than me - it's the same thing. Node has
*two* package managers - "Yarn" and "npm" - I know, kinda weird - but you can install
and use whichever you want. Anyways, this is downloading our 3 libraries and their
dependencies into Node's version of the `vendor/` directory: `node_modules/`.

And... done! Congrats! You now have a gigantic `node_modules/` directory... because
JavaScript has tons of dependencies. Oh, the recipe *also* updated our `.gitignore`
file to *ignore* `node_modules/`:

[[[ code('75a4f84a78') ]]]

Just like with Composer, there is *no* reason to commit this stuff. This *also*
ignores `public/build/`, which is where Webpack will *put* our final, built files.

## Hello webpack.config.js

In fact, I'll show you why. At the root of your app, the recipe added the most
important file of all `webpack.config.js`:

[[[ code('cd18d48c46') ]]]

*This* is the configuration file that Encore reads. Actually, if you use Webpack
by itself, you would have this *exact* same file! Encore is basically a configuration
generator: you tell it how you want Webpack to behave and then, *all* the way
at the bottom, say:

> Please give me the standard Webpack config that will give me that behavior.

Encore makes things easy, but it's *still* true Webpack under-the-hood.

Most of the stuff in this file is for configuring some optional features that we'll
talk about along the way - so ignore it all for now. The three *super* important
things that *we* need to talk about are output path, public path and this `addEntry()`
thing:

[[[ code('0907d90e80') ]]]

Let's do that next, *build* our first Webpack'ed files and include them on the page.
