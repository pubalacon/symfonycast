# Email Context & the Magic "email" Variable

When you set the HTML part of an email, Mailer helps out by creating
the "text" version for us! It's not perfect... and we'll fix that soon...
but... it's a nice start! If you *did* want to control this manually, in
`SecurityController`, you could set this the text by calling either the
`text()` method or `textTemplate()` to render a template that would only contain
text.

## Passing Variables (context)

In both cases - `htmlTemplate()` and `textTemplate()` - you're probably going to
want to pass some *data* into the template to make the mail dynamic. The way to
do this is *not* via a second argument to `htmlTemplate()`. Nope, to pass variables
into the templates, call `context()` and give this an `array`. Let's pass a
`user` variable set to the `$user` that was just registered.

[[[ code('b1fc955800') ]]]

As *soon* as we do this, in `welcome.html.twig`, we can replace that weird `%name%`
placeholder with `{{ user.firstName }}`... because `user` is a instance of our
`User` entity... and it has a `getFirstName()` method on it.

[[[ code('aaad760d8b') ]]]

Let's try it! In your browser, go back one page, tweak the email, type a password,
hit enter and then... there it is! Nice to meet you "Fox".

## The Built-in "app" and "email" Variables

But wait, there's more! In addition to whatever variables you pass via `context()`,
you *also* have access to exactly two *other* variables... absolutely free. What
a deal!

The first one... we already know: it's the `app` variable... which *every*
Twig template in Symfony can access. It's useful if you need read info from
the session, the request, get the current user or a few other things.

The *other* variable that you magically get access to in all email templates is
more interesting. It's called... `emu`. I mean, `email`... and is *not* a
large flightless bird from Australia... which would be awesome... but less useful.
Nope, it's an an instance of `WrappedTemplatedEmail`.

## Hello WrappedTemplatedEmail

I'll hit Shift+Shift and look for `WrappedTemplatedEmail` under "classes".

This is a *super* powerful class... full of *tons* of info. It gives us
access to things like the name of *who* the email is being sent to - more about
that in a minute - the subject, return path... and it even allows us to *configure*
a few things on the email, like embedding an image right from Twig!

We're not going to talk about *all* of these methods... but basically, *any*
information about the email itself can be found here... and it even allows you
to *change* a few things about the email... all from inside Twig.

Go back to the `welcome.html.twig` email template. All the way at the top, we have
a `title` tag set to

> Welcome to the Space Bar!

Having a `<title>` tag in an email.... is usually not *that* important... but
it doesn't hurt to have it and make it match the email's subject. Now that we
know about the `email` variable, we can do this properly. Change the text to
`{{ email.subject }}`.

## NamedAddress and email.toName()

***TIP
In Symfony 4.4 and higher, you won't see `NamedAddress` mentioned here.
But the idea is the same: an address can consist of an email and a "name".
***

Back inside `WrappedTemplatedEmail`, all the way on top, one of my *favorite*
methods is `toName()`. When you're sending an email to just *one* person, this
is a *super* nice way to get that person's name. It's interesting... if the
"to" is an instance of `NamedAddress`, it returns `$to->getName()`. Otherwise it
returns an empty `string`.

What is that `NamedAddress`? Go back to `SecurityController`. Hmm, for the `to()`
address... we passed an email *string*... and that's a *totally* legal thing
to do. But instead of a string, this method *also* accepts a `NamedAddress`
object... or even an *array* of `NamedAddress` objects.

***TIP
In Symfony 4.4 and higher, use `new Address()` - it works the same way
as the `NamedAddress` we describe here.
***

Check this out: replace the email string with a `new NamedAddress()`. This takes
two arguments: the address that we're sending to - `$user->getEmail()` - *and*
the "name" that you want to identify this person as. Let's use
`$user->getFirstName()`.

[[[ code('b8c20ef12a') ]]]

We can do the same thing with from. I'll copy the from email address and replace
it with `new NamedAddress()`, `alienmailer@example.com` and for the name, we're
sending as `The Space Bar`.

[[[ code('fd97b7dcdb') ]]]

This is actually even cooler than it looks... and helps us in *two* ways. First,
in `welcome.html.twig`, we can use the `email` object to get the name of the person
we're sending to instead of needing the `user` variable.

To prove it, let's get crazy and comment-out the `user`  variable in context.

[[[ code('deef9b0c79') ]]]

In the template, use `{{ email.toName }}`. This will call the `toName()` method...
which *should* give us the first name.

[[[ code('9b388ed7b1') ]]]

This is nice... but the *real* advantage of `NamedAddress` can be seen in
the inbox.

Try the flow from the start: find your browser, go back, change the email again -
we'll be doing this a lot - type a password, submit and... go check Mailtrap.
There it is:

> Nice to meet you Fox.

It's *now* getting that from the `NamedAddress`. The *real* beauty is
on top: from "The Space Bar", then the email and to "Fox" next to that email.
This is how pretty much *all* emails you receive appear to come from a
specific "name", not just an address.

## The "Check HTML"

By the way, one of the tabs in Mailtrap is "Check HTML"... which is kinda cool...
well... only "kind of". There is a *lot* of variability on how different email
clients *render* emails, like some apparently don't support using the
`background-color` style attribute. Crazy!

If you *really* want to test how your emails looks, this "Check HTML" tab probably
isn't going to help too much - there are other services like Litmus that can help
you. But this *does* highlight one *huge* thing we're doing wrong. It says that
some `style` thing on line 7 isn't supported. That's referring to the `style` tag.
It turns out that Gmail doesn't support embedding CSS in your email: it doesn't
let you do it with a `style` tag *or* with a CSS file. Nope, to make things look
good in gmail, you *must* manually put all the styles as style *attributes*
on *every* single element. Gross. Fortunately, Mailer will help us with this.
We'll see how soon.

But first, let's *perfect* how our auto-generated text content looks...
by running one command and high-fiving Mailer.
