# Ink: Automatic CSS Email Framework

Our email template is HTML... very *traditional* HTML. What I mean is, this is
the type of HTML and CSS you would see on a normal website. And, at least inside
Mailtrap... it looks good! But a *big* lesson of sending emails is that the HTML
is often *not* rendered like a normal browser would render it. Some email clients
don't support float or flexbox... so if you're using *those* to establish an
email layout then... oof, it's going to look *bad* for some people... like people
using gmail.

If you want to write an email that's going to look consistently good in every
email client, the best practice is actually to use *tables* for your layout. If
you have *no* idea what a table layout is... oh, you are *so*, *so* lucky. Back
in the dark ages of the Internet, back before CSS float and flexbox existed,
every webpage's layout consisted of tables, rows and cells. It was tables, inside
of tables, inside of tables, inside of tables. It was... a nightmare.

So... um... am I saying that the nightmare of needing to write table-based layouts
is *still* a reality when you create emails? Yes... and no. Mailer has another
trick up its sleeve.

## Hello Ink / Foundation for Emails

Google for "Inky Framework" to find something called "Ink" by "Zurb". Let me
define... a few things. Zurb is the name of a company, a cool name - it sounds
like an alien race: "the Zurb". Anyways, Zurb is the company that created
"Foundation": a CSS framework that's probably the second most famous in the
world behind Bootstrap. "Ink" is the name of a CSS framework that's designed
*specifically* for emails. And actually, they've renamed "Ink" to just
"Foundation for Emails".

So, Ink, or Foundation for Emails is a CSS framework for responsive HTML emails
that works on any device. Even Outlook! Click on the docs.

Foundation for emails is basically two parts. First, it's a CSS file that defines
useful CSS classes and a grid structure for designing emails. Again... it's just
like Bootstrap CSS for emails.

## The Inky Templating Language

That CSS file is super handy. But the *second* part of Foundation for emails is
even *more* interesting. Click the "Inky" link on the left. The *second* part
of this library is centered around a custom templating language called "Inky".
It's a simple, but *fascinating* tool. Click the "Switch to Inky" link.

Here's the idea: *we* write HTML using some custom Inky HTML tags, like
`<container>`, `<row>` and `<columns>`... as well as a few others like
`<button>` and `<menu>`. Then, Inky will *transform* this pretty HTML into the
crazy, ugly table-based layout required for it to render in an email! Yea, it
lets us have table-based emails... without needing to use tables! Yeehaw!

## Using the inky_to_html Filter

Now if you downloaded the course code, you should have a `tutorial/` directory,
which holds the original `welcome.html.twig` *and* an `inky/` directory with an
*updated* `welcome.html.twig`. New stuff!

This is basically the same template but written in that special "Inky" markup:
containers, rows, columns, etc. Copy the contents... and let's close a few things.
Then open up `templates/email/welcome.html.twig` and *completely* replace this file
with the updated version.

It's *really* the same email as before: it has the same dynamic URLs and is printing
the recipient's name. It's *just* different markup. Oh, and notice that the
`inline_css()` stuff we added a few minutes ago is *gone*! Gasp! Don't worry: we'll
put that back in a minute. But until then, forget about CSS.

If we sent this email right now, it would *literally* send with this markup. To
*transform* this into the table-based markup we want, we'll use another special
filter on the *entire* template. On top, add `{% apply inky_to_html %}`... and
*all* the way at the bottom, put `{% endapply %}`. I'll indent this to make it
look nice.

[[[ code('a1250e71f4') ]]]

Let's try it! Find your browser and make sure you're on the registration page.
Let's register as `thetruthisoutthere11@example.com`, any password, check the
terms, register and... error!

Ah, but we know this error! Well, not this *exact* error, but almost! This is
Twig telling us that we're trying to use a filter that requires an extra library.
Cool! Copy the composer require line, move back over to your terminal, and paste:

```terminal
composer require twig/inky-extra
```

***TIP
Make sure you have XSL extension installed for your PHP to be able to use Inky.
To check it - you can run `php -m | grep xsl` in your console and check the output
has "xsl".
***

When that finishes... move back to your browser, go *back* to the registration
form, tweak that email and... deep breath... register! I think it worked!
Let's go check it out.

There's the new email! Oof, it looks *terrible*... but that's only because it
doesn't any CSS yet. Check out the HTML source. So cool: it *transformed* our
clean markup into table elements! We just took a *huge* step towards making our
emails look good in every email client... without needing to write bad markup.

## Inlining the foundation-emails CSS

To get this to *look* good, we need to include some CSS from Foundation for Emails.
Go back to the documentation, click on the "CSS Version" link and click download.
When you unzip this, you'll find a `foundation-emails.css` file inside. Copy that...
and paste it into, how about, the `assets/css` directory.

How do we include this in our email template? We already know how: the `inline_css`
filter. But instead of adding *another* apply tag around the entire template, we
can piggyback off of inky! Add `|inline_css` and pass this `source()` and the path
to the CSS file: `@styles/foundation-emails.css`.

Remember: if you look in `config/packages/twig.yaml`, we set up a path that
allows us to say `@styles` to refer to the `assets/css` directory. That's how this
path works.

And... I still *do* want to include my custom `email.css` code. Copy the `source()`
stuff, add a *second* argument to `inline_css` - you can pass this as *many* arguments
of CSS as you want - and point this at `email.css`.

[[[ code('edc181a642') ]]]

That should do it! Oh, but before we try this, back in `tutorial/`, that `inky/`
directory *also* holds an `email.css` file. Now that we're using a CSS framework,
some of the code in our original `email.css`... just isn't needed anymore! This
new `email.css` is basically the same as the original one... but with some extra
stuff removed. Copy the code from the file, and paste it over the one in `assets/css`.

[[[ code('765a078bec') ]]]

Ok, time to see the final product! Go back to the registration page, update the
email, add a password, enter and... go check out Mailtrap. There it is and...
it looks awesome. Well, it looks *exactly* like it did before, but in the HTML
source, now that we have a table-based layout, we know this will display more
consistently across all email clients. I won't say *perfect*... because you'll
need to do some testing - but it's now *much* more likely to look good.

So that's "Foundation for Emails". It's, one, a CSS framework for emails... a lot
like Bootstrap for emails... and two, a tool to transform the pretty markup known
as Inky into the ugly table-based HTML that the CSS framework styles and that
email clients require.

## Watch your Email Sizes

Before we keep going, one thing to watch out for *regardless* of how you're styling
your emails, is email size. It's *far* from a science, but gmail tends to truncate
emails once their size is greater than about 100kb: it hides the rest of the email
with a link to see more. Keep that in mind, but more than anything, test your emails
to make sure they look good in the real world!

Next, let's bootstrap a console command that will send some emails! It turns out
that sending emails in a console command requires an extra trick.
