# Styling Emails with Encore & Sass Part 1

Our app uses Webpack Encore to manage its frontend assets. It's not something we
talked much about because, if you downloaded the course code from this page, it
already included the final `build/` directory. I did this so we didn't need to
worry about setting up Encore *just* to get the site working.

But if you *are* using Encore, we can make a few improvements to how we're
styling our emails. Specifically, we took *two* shortcuts. First, the
`assets/css/foundation-emails.css` file is something we downloaded from
the Foundation website. That's not how we would *normally* do things with Encore.
If we need to use a third-party library, we typically install it with `yarn` instead
of committing it directly.

The other shortcut was with this `emails.css` file. I'd *rather* use Sass... but
to do that, I need to process it through Encore.

## Installing Foundation Emails via Yarn

Let's get to work! Over in the terminal, start by installing all the current
Encore dependencies with:

```terminal
yarn install
```

When that finishes, install Foundation for Emails with:

```terminal
yarn add foundation-emails --dev
```

The *end* result is that we now have a giant `node_modules/` directory and...
somewhere *way* down in this giant directory... we'll find a
`foundation-emails` directory with a `foundation-emails.css` file inside. They
also have a Sass file if you want to import *that* and control things further...
but the CSS file is good enough for us.

Before we make any real changes, make sure Encore can build by running:

```terminal
yarn dev --watch
```

And... excellent! Everything is working.

## Using Sass & Importing Foundation Emails

Now that we've installed Foundation for Emails properly, let's delete the committed
file: I'll right click and go to "Refactor -> Delete". Next, because I want to
use Sass for our custom email styling, right click on `email.css`, go to
"Refactor -> Rename" and call it `email.scss`.

Because this file will be processed through Encore, we can import the
`foundation-email.css` file from right here with `@import`, a `~` - that tells
Webpack to look in the `node_modules/` directory - then
`foundation-emails/dist/foundation-emails.css`.

[[[ code('a11c9502a6') ]]]

This feels good! I'll close up `node_modules/`... cause it's giant.

## Creating the Email Entry

Now open up the email layout file: `templates/email/emailBase.html.twig`. When we used
`inline_css()`, we pointed it at the `foundation-emails.css` file *and* the
`email.css` file. But now... we only really need to point it at `email.scss`...
because, in theory, that will include the styles from *both* files.

[[[ code('d626d1374f') ]]]

The problem is that this is now a *Sass* file... and `inline_css` only works
with CSS files: we can't point it at a Sass file and expect it transform the Sass
into CSS. And even if it *were* a CSS file, the `@import` won't work unless we
process this through Encore.

So here's the plan: we're going to pretend that `email.scss` is just an ordinary
CSS file that we want to include on some page on our site. Open up
`webpack.config.js`. Whenever we have some page-specific CSS or JS, we add a
new *entry* for it. In this case, because we don't need any JavaScript, we can
add a "style" entry. Say `.addStyleEntry()` - call the entry, how about, `email`,
and point it at the file: `./assets/css/email.scss`.

[[[ code('5fa91e4e69') ]]]

To get Webpack to see the updated config, in the terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop
Encore and restart it:

```terminal-silent
yarn dev --watch
```

And... it builds! Interesting: the `email` entrypoint dumped *two* CSS files.
Let's look at the `public/build` directory. Yep: `email.css` and also this
`vendors~email.css`.

This is thanks to an optimization that Wepback Encore makes when you use
`splitEntryChunks()`... which you can learn *all* about in our
[Encore tutorial](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/webpack-encore).
But the basic point is that if we want *all* of the CSS from the built `email.scss`
file, we need to include *both* `email.css` *and* `vendor~email.css`.

Ok, easy, right? In the template, we could load the source of `vendor~email.css`
and `email.css`. The *problem* is that Webpack splits the files in a very dynamic
fashion: if it finds a more efficient way to split the files tomorrow - maybe
into *three* files - it will! Plus, when we do our production build, the files
will include a dynamic *hash* in their filename - like `email.123abc.css`.

So... we need to do a bit more work to reliably load this stuff through
`inline_css()`. Let's do that next with a custom Twig function.
